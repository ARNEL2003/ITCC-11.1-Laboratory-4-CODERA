# Classic Tic Tac Toe (AWT Edition)

## 📝 Brief Description
This straightforward and vibrant desktop Tic Tac Toe game was created with Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit). The game allows two players to alternately place their X or O on a 3x3 grid. All of the fundamental game mechanics are included, including win checking, draw detection, and a "New Game" button for board resets. To make the user interface more engaging, background colors, player highlights, and status updates have been added.

Developed by Arnel Enrico Paolo D. Codera for ITCC 11.1 Section A, Lab Activity 4.
